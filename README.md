# Pi-Control for LEDWall-based Matrices and SmartLights

This is a script, which you can run on any smart home server (e.g. Raspberry Pi) to automatically control the brightness of you smart home lights.


It pings the devices you configure it to and disables all lights, if none of the devices are pingable, and enables lights, if they are pingable. Also time conrtol can be added based on the local time of the device it's running on.
